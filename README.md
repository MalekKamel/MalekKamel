ü§î I'm currently interested in exploring new challenges as a mobile software engineer specializing in native iOS and Android development and Flutter, [My Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12OrUUblKxuHg8baFt4xmtcNvEj9qjsUL/view?usp=sharing).

‚ÄúAchieve excellence, don‚Äôt just avoid errors ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ One of my favorite quotes..

As a mobile engineer, I have over 8 years of experience in native iOS and Android development. With a strong foundation in both platforms. 

As a GitHub contributor, I am proud to have received over 465 stars for my contributions to the community. Through 53 public repositories, including 16 Android libraries, 5 iOS libraries, 1 Flutter library, I have made significant contributions to the open-source community.

My passion for reusability and clean code drives me to write open-source libraries and projects that can benefit the community of developers. Moving forward, my goal is to focus on building SDKs and APIs that can be easily integrated into any project, thereby empowering developers to build better software and achieve their goals more efficiently.

As a public speaker, I have had the opportunity to participate in Google Developer Groups (GDG) and share my knowledge and expertise with fellow developers

I love sharing my knowledge and experience, contribute to open source projects related to mobile development, and
sharing PoCs & problems as code on this account.
